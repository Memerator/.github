# Security Policy

Vulnerabilities are something we take seriously on Memerator. **Please do not open an issue for vulnerabilities**! Please read our guidelines below.

## Finding Vulnerabilities

You cannot use any illegal methods of finding vulnerabilities unless otherwise recruited by a Memerator Staff member.

For the main site, discovering a vulnerability via page code editing (such as with Inspect Element) is allowed and must be disclosed appropriately below.

Vulnerabilities can be tested and found on any Memerator platform, such as the [Main Site](https://memerator.me), the [Beta Site](https://beta.memerator.me), and the API.

## Defining a Vulnerability

A vulnerability is something that gives you unauthorized access to a resource or index. Examples include:

* Ability to view or edit a user's private details.
* Ability to edit other user's property (such as memes and ratings).
* Ability to view information not intended to be accessible to the general public.
* Ability to run unauthorized code or scripts from an external or internal source.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, we request you [create a ticket](https://memerator.me/support). 
If you prefer, please provide a valid email to get back to you and update you.

## Disclaimer

Any attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities will result in a permanent ban from Memerator, and in severe cases, a legal investigation.
If you find one, please report it immediately because your account will be permanently banned if you are discovered to be using it.
